Track your mileage, get better gas mileage!

Ajax is just plain awesome, what more can I say!

How I made this app...

-- Creating a new XMLHttpRequest Object on submit of the form
-- Passing the form values as a query string to the RESTful create action in the Mileage controller
-- Calculating the three calculated values on the fly in the controller
-- Parsing the json file sent as a callback
-- DOM Manipulation!!
-- Returning the submit action as false to not submit the form
(Lots of small clean up tasks...)
